# Solari Cookbook

Short, runnable examples for [Solari](https://getsolari.com) — cloud browsers,
sandboxes, and desktops behind one API key.

Every example in this repo is a complete program you can run in under a minute.
They are deliberately small: one idea each, no framework, no scaffolding to read
past. Copy one into your project and change the parts you care about.

## Featured systems build

### [GhostAck](examples/ghostack-ts)

**[Open the interactive chaos lab](https://ghostack-control-lab-980932890834.us-east1.run.app/)**

Crash-consistent execution for browser agents. A Solari browser deliberately
dies after a sandbox-hosted target commits an operation but before the browser
receives the acknowledgement. A fresh recovery browser performs an authoritative
receipt lookup, proves the effect already exists, and does **not** click twice.

The implementation includes a hash-chained write-ahead log, intent binding,
single-flight concurrency control, target-side idempotency, read-after-unknown
reconciliation, fault injection, and a reproducible evidence dashboard. It also
states the important boundary plainly: exactly-once cannot be promised when a
target offers neither idempotency nor an authoritative read.

```bash
cd examples/ghostack-ts
pnpm install
pnpm demo:local     # 100 deterministic fault schedules, no key required
pnpm demo           # real Solari sandbox + recorded browser when SOLARI_API_KEY is set
```

## Examples

### Cloud browser

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [browser-quickstart-ts](examples/browser-quickstart-ts) | TypeScript | Launch a browser, open a page, read it |
| [browser-quickstart-py](examples/browser-quickstart-py) | Python | Launch a browser, open a page, read it |
| [browser-stealth-proxy-ts](examples/browser-stealth-proxy-ts) | TypeScript | Stealth mode + residential proxy egress |
| [browser-profiles-ts](examples/browser-profiles-ts) | TypeScript | Log in once, reuse the session forever |
| [browser-session-recording-py](examples/browser-session-recording-py) | Python | Record a session, download the replay |

### Sandbox

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [sandbox-quickstart-ts](examples/sandbox-quickstart-ts) | TypeScript | Run a command, write and read files |
| [sandbox-code-interpreter-py](examples/sandbox-code-interpreter-py) | Python | Stateful Python kernel for agent loops |
| [sandbox-port-preview-ts](examples/sandbox-port-preview-ts) | TypeScript | Expose a server in the VM on a public URL |

### Desktop

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [desktop-computer-use-py](examples/desktop-computer-use-py) | Python | Screenshot, click, and type on a Linux GUI |

### End-to-end systems

| Example | Language | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ghostack-ts](examples/ghostack-ts) | TypeScript | Reviewer-triggered chaos testing for exactly-once side effects across browser crashes and coordinator restarts |

## Running an example

Each directory is self-contained.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solari-sdk/solari-cookbook.git
cd solari-cookbook/examples/browser-quickstart-ts

npm install                          # or: pip install -r requirements.txt
export SOLARI_API_KEY=slr_live_...   # grab one at console.getsolari.com
npm start                            # or: python main.py
```

One `slr_live_` key works across browsers, sandboxes, and desktops, and every
product bills to the same balance.

## Which product do I want?

- **Cloud browser** — you need a *web page*: scraping, testing, filling forms,
  anything Playwright or Puppeteer would do locally. Adds stealth, managed
  proxies, captcha solving, profiles, and session recording.
- **Sandbox** — you need to *run code*: an LLM's Python, an untrusted build, a
  data job. A headless microVM that boots from a snapshot in about a second.
- **Desktop** — you need a *screen*: computer-use agents, GUI apps, anything
  that has to be clicked. A sandbox plus X11 and a live VNC stream.

## Gotchas the examples encode

Things that cost you an afternoon if you meet them cold:

- **TypeScript: call `await solari.close()`.** The browser client keeps a
  loopback proxy open for connection retries. Skip the close and your script
  prints its output and then hangs forever instead of exiting.
- **Recording is per session, not per account.** Pass `recording: true` when you
  create the session; without it the replay endpoint 404s forever. The upload is
  async after release, so poll for ~30s before giving up.
- **Sandbox commands are not shell-interpreted.** `run("ls -la")` looks for a
  binary named `ls -la`. Put argv in `args`, or run `sh -c` explicitly.
- **`kill()`, not `close()`, ends a VM.** `close()` drops your local control
  channel; the VM keeps running until its idle timeout.
- **`timeoutMs` is a rolling idle window**, not a hard deadline — it resets on
  every use.

New examples are welcome. Keep them small, make them run end-to-end against the
real API, and put anything surprising in a comment right where it bites.
